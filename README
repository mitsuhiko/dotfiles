Hey,

This are my public dotfiles.  They might not work for you, but feel free
to steal from them.

You will also need my vcprompt branch if you want to use my
bash prompt: https://bitbucket.org/mitsuhiko/vcprompt

If you want fancy colors in the Terminal, you will need the SIMBL
plugin (http://www.culater.net/software/SIMBL/SIMBL.php) as well
as the TerminalColors plugin.  I have a fork of it on github that
is configured to compile for 32bit and 64bit and works for Snow
Leopard (http://github.com/mitsuhiko/terminalcolours).
